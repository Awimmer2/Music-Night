# PROGRESS SINCE LAST SPRINT REVIEW

## What has been done since last time?
- Created a questionnaire, to find the user's genre based on their answers
- After completeing the questionnaire, they get 3 random playlists on spotify that fit to that genre

## Problems
- We wanted to give 1 playlist and shows maximum of 10 songs on it, however the chart did not work, so we did the 3 random playlists instead.

## Plans
- About Page (about the website)
- Team Page (about team)
- Finishing all Genre pages

## Number of Commits since last  sprint review
- Audrey: 20 Commits
- Behrang: 8 Commits
